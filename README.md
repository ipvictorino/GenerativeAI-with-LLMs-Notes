[Generative AI with Large Language Models](https://www.coursera.org/learn/generative-ai-with-llms?utm_campaign=WebsiteCoursesGAIA&utm_medium=institutions&utm_source=deeplearning-ai#modules)

This course will take a deep dive into how LLM technology actually works, including:

- Model training
- Instruction training
- Fine-Tuning
- GenAI project life cycle framework

GenAI and LLMs are **general purpose technology**

This course was presented in partnership with AWS.

Scope:

1. **Week 1**: Examine Transformer Architecture, explore how these models are trained, and understand compute resources required to develop these powerfull LLMs. Learn about a technique called in-context learning: how to guide the model to output at inference time with prompt engineering. Learn how to tune the most important generation parameters of LLMs 
2. **Week 2:** Explore options for adapting pre-trained models to specific tasks and dataset via a process called instruction fine-tuning.
3. **Week 3**: See how to align the outputs of large language models with human values (RLHF), in order to increase helpfulness and decrease potential harm and toxicity

Each week includes hands-on labs

[Week 1](Week%201.md)

[Week 2](Week%202.md)

[Week 3](Week%203.md)
